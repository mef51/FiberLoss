Some questions we should be able to use the model to answer.

Context and Definitions:
* a "node" is node of Ranvier on an axon
* a "fiber" or "nerve fiber" is the axon of a neuron
* a "nerve bundle" or just "nerve" is a bundle of fibers.
* a "damaged node" means Coupled left-shifted Sodium channels on a node
* "signal" and "spikes" refer to action potentials
* "propagation" refers to the saltatory propagation of a spike on a myelinated fiber


* Imagine a fiber with connected nodes. If one of the nodes is stimulated, will the signal propagate through a node further
down the fiber that is damaged? How much damage until the signal is stopped completely? If the signal does propagate through a damaged node how is the signal affected?

* If the node being stimulated is damaged, can it be excited? How much damage until it can no longer be excited? This may have been answered in Boucher's paper (2012)

* If all the nodes in a fiber are slightly damaged how does that change the speed of the signal being propagated?
